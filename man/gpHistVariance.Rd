\title{
  gpHistVariance Function
}
\description{
  This function is used to estimate (approximate) the variance of new samples from a trained GP.
}
\usage{
gpHistVariance( GP,X,x_pred)
}

\arguments{
  \item{GP}{
    Gaussian Process object that has been trained with gpHist
  }
  \item{X}{
    Data that has been used to train the GP object
  }
  \item{x_pred}{
    New data whos variance has to be predicted
  }
}
\details{
Based on the number of estimaited eigenvalues/eigenvetors, the variance is approximated. When only 1 eigenvalue is used, the so-called coarse approximation is used. If more eigenvectors are present, the so- called fine approximation is used. Estimation of eigenvalue and vector for the coarse approximation is done using power iteration. This is considerably faster than approximations of multiple eigenvectors using Lanczos algorithm followed by bounding the eigenvalues using Sturm sequences and inverse iteration for the estimation of the eigenvector.

For deatils look in to paper of refrenced under references
}
\value{
 Will return NAN on error or the estimated approximaited variances of the samples

\note{
  A negative variance can be retunred. This can happen when one eigenvalue is not the highest, rather a lower one. Might also happen when eigenvalue and/or eigenvector is not estimated accurate enough. 
As workaround consider using less eigenvectors for the estimation of the Gaussian process. Or remove the lowest eigenvalue and vector from the object and call the variance function again. This of course will you provide a worse approximation, but give you a valid variance that you might be able to use instead.
